<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PBS Biodegradable Plastic Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Complete Degradation</li><li>Partial Degradation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Complete Degradation market refers to biodegradable plastics that can fully break down into natural elements like water, carbon dioxide, and biomass, leaving no harmful residues behind. Partial Degradation market, on the other hand, includes biodegradable plastics that only partially break down into smaller pieces but do not fully degrade into harmless substances. Both types of biodegradable plastics aim to reduce environmental impact by minimizing plastic waste accumulation. However, complete degradation plastics are considered more environmentally friendly due to their ability to completely biodegrade.</p></p>
