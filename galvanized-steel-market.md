<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Galvanized Steel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hot-dip Galvanized Steel</li><li>Electrical Galvanized Steel</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Galvanized steel is divided into two main types: hot-dip galvanized steel and electrical galvanized steel. Hot-dip galvanized steel is coated by immersing the steel in a bath of molten zinc, providing a thicker and more durable coating. Electrical galvanized steel, on the other hand, is coated by electroplating the steel with zinc, resulting in a thinner but smoother coating. Both types of galvanized steel offer corrosion resistance and are widely used in construction, automotive, and industrial applications.</p></p>
