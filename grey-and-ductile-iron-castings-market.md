<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Grey and Ductile Iron Castings Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vertical Molding</li><li>Horizontal Molding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vertical molding is a type of iron casting process where the mold is placed upright and the molten metal is poured into it from above. This method is commonly used for larger, more complex castings. Horizontal molding, on the other hand, involves laying the mold flat and pouring the metal into it from the side. This method is often preferred for smaller, simpler castings. Both vertical and horizontal molding offer advantages and limitations depending on the specific requirements of the casting project.</p></p>
