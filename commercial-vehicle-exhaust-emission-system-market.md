<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR system</li><li>EGR system</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle Exhaust Emission System market includes two main types: Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems and Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems. SCR systems work by injecting a reductant into the exhaust stream to convert harmful nitrogen oxides into harmless nitrogen and water. On the other hand, EGR systems recirculate a portion of exhaust gas back into the engine cylinders to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Both systems are crucial in helping commercial vehicles meet stringent emissions regulations and improve air quality.</p></p>
