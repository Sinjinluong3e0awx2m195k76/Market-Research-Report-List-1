<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Food Twin-screw Extruder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Parallel Co-rotating</li><li>Parallel Counter-rotating</li><li>Conical</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Food twin-screw extruders can be categorized into three main types based on the direction of the screws: parallel co-rotating, parallel counter-rotating, and conical. In parallel co-rotating extruders, the twin screws rotate in the same direction, aiding in efficient mixing and blending of ingredients. Parallel counter-rotating extruders have screws that rotate in opposite directions, providing high shear forces for specific applications. Conical extruders have a tapering barrel shape, allowing for better control over material flow and processing conditions.</p></p>
