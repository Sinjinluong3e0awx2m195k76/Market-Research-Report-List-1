<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Injection Peptide Drug Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous Injection</li><li>Subcutaneous Injection</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Injection Peptide Drug Market consists of two main types: Intravenous Injection and Subcutaneous Injection. Intravenous Injection involves delivering the drug directly into the bloodstream through a vein, allowing for rapid absorption and immediate effect. Subcutaneous Injection involves injecting the drug into the fatty tissue layer just beneath the skin, resulting in slower absorption but a longer-lasting effect. Both methods have their own advantages and are chosen based on the specific requirements of the drug and the patient's condition.</p></p>
