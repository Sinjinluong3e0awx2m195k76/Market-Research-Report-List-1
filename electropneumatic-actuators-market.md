<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electropneumatic Actuators Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single Acting Actuator</li><li>Double Acting Actuator</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Electropneumatic Actuators come in two main types: Single Acting Actuators and Double Acting Actuators. Single Acting Actuators use air pressure to move the actuator in one direction, with a spring returning it to its original position when the pressure is released. Double Acting Actuators, on the other hand, use air pressure to move the actuator in both directions, allowing for precise control over the positioning of the actuator. These actuators are commonly used in various industrial applications for controlling valves, dampers, and other mechanical systems.</p></p>
