<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Harvester Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Agriculture Tires</li><li>Bias (Crossply) Agriculture Tires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Agricultural harvester tyres come in two main types: radial agriculture tires and bias (crossply) agriculture tires. Radial agriculture tires are designed with a radial construction, providing a larger footprint for better traction and reduced soil compaction. Bias agriculture tires, on the other hand, have a crossply construction with crisscrossed layers of ply cords, offering a stronger sidewall and better resistance to punctures. Both types have specific advantages and are chosen based on the requirements of the harvester and the terrain it will be operating on.</p></p>
