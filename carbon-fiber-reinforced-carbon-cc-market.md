<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon (C/C) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chemical Vapor Deposition</li><li>Liquid Impregnation Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Carbon Fiber-Reinforced Carbon (C/C) is a material known for its high strength, stiffness, and heat resistance. Two common types of manufacturing processes for C/C materials are Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) and Liquid Impregnation Process. In the CVD method, carbon fibers are coated with a carbon matrix in a high-temperature chemical reaction. On the other hand, the Liquid Impregnation Process involves saturating carbon fibers with a liquid resin, which is then cured to form a solid matrix. Both methods result in lightweight and durable C/C materials suitable for aerospace, automotive, and industrial applications.</p></p>
