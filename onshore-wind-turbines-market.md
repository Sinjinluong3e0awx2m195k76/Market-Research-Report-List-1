<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Onshore Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Onshore wind turbines are classified into two main market types: Horizontal Axis Wind Turbines (HAWT) and Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWT). HAWTs have blades that rotate around a horizontal axis, facing into the wind to generate electricity. They are more commonly used due to their higher efficiency in converting wind into power. On the other hand, VAWTs have blades that rotate around a vertical axis, making them suitable for urban and rooftop installations. Each type has its own advantages and applications in the onshore wind energy market.</p></p>
