<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Continuously Variable Transmissions Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Metal Belt</li><li>Metal Chain</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Continuously Variable Transmissions (CVT) Systems consist of two main types: Metal Belt and Metal Chain. Metal Belt CVTs use a metal belt to transfer power between the engine and the wheels with a variable-speed pulley system. On the other hand, Metal Chain CVTs use a metal chain to achieve the same variable gear ratios. Both types offer smooth and seamless transitions between gears, improving fuel efficiency and overall performance in vehicles. These technologies are popular in the automotive industry for their ability to optimize engine output.</p></p>
