<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Thermal Barcode Printers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Direct Thermal</li><li>Thermal Transfer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary thermal barcode printers are divided into two main types: direct thermal and thermal transfer. Direct thermal printers use heat-sensitive paper to produce high-quality, durable labels without the need for ink or ribbons. In contrast, thermal transfer printers use a heated print head to transfer wax or resin onto labels, creating long-lasting prints that are resistant to smudging and fading. Both types of printers are widely used in industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare for printing barcodes, labels, and tags.</p></p>
