<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Purity Phosphine Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>99.9999% Purity</li><li>Below 99.9999% Purity</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High purity phosphine market types include 99.9999% purity and below 99.9999% purity. Phosphine with 99.9999% purity is considered ultra-high purity and is often used in advanced industrial applications where impurities must be kept to an absolute minimum. On the other hand, phosphine with below 99.9999% purity may be suitable for less sensitive applications where a slightly lower level of purity is acceptable. The choice between the two types depends on the specific requirements of the application and the desired level of quality.</p></p>
