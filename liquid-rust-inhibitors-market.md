<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Rust Inhibitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Nitrite-Based Liquid</li><li>Nitrite-Free Liquid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid rust inhibitors are divided into two main types: nitrite-based and nitrite-free. Nitrite-based liquid rust inhibitors contain nitrites, chemicals that help to prevent rusting through a process called passivation. These inhibitors work by forming a protective film over the metal surface, preventing the oxidation process. On the other hand, nitrite-free liquid rust inhibitors do not contain nitrites and use alternative corrosion inhibitors to prevent rust formation. Both types of inhibitors are widely used in industrial applications to protect metal surfaces from corrosion.</p></p>
