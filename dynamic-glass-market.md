<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dynamic Glass Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SPD</li><li>PDLC</li><li>Electrochromic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dynamic Glass refers to smart glass technology that can change its transparency levels based on external stimuli. There are three main types of Dynamic Glass: SPD (Suspended Particle Device), PDLC (Polymer Dispersed Liquid Crystal), and Electrochromic. SPD glass uses suspended particles to control light transmission, while PDLC glass utilizes a polymer matrix with liquid crystals for opacity adjustment. Electrochromic glass changes tint through the application of an electrical voltage. Each type offers unique benefits and applications in the market for energy-efficient and customizable windows.</p></p>
