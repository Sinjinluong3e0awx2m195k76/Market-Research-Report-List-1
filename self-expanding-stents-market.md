<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-Expanding Stents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vascular Stent</li><li>Non-vascular Stent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-expanding stents are medical devices used to treat narrowed or blocked blood vessels. There are two main types of self-expanding stents: vascular stents and non-vascular stents. Vascular stents are used in conditions such as coronary artery disease and peripheral artery disease, while non-vascular stents are used in conditions affecting other organs like the esophagus, bile ducts, or ureters. Both types of stents work by expanding to open up the blocked or narrowed vessel, helping to improve blood flow and alleviate symptoms.</p></p>
